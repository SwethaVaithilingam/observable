<!--

In Angular, an Observable is a key concept from the RxJS (Reactive Extensions for JavaScript) library, which is widely used for handling asynchronous operations such as HTTP requests, user input events, and other data streams. Observables allow you to subscribe to data streams and react to data changes in a flexible way.

Key Concepts of Observables
Observable: Represents a stream of values over time. It can be used to handle multiple values (like an array) or a single value asynchronously.

Observer: An object that receives notifications from the Observable. It has methods like next(), error(), and complete().
